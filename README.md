# Django Test Project
A learning journey

## Created an endpoint for some JWT experimentation
JSON Web Tokens are a common method today of validating requests. I aim to try it out for myself.

## Project Status
Experimental work in progress
I can accept new user information and save it in the db, returning a JWT, or I can error out over the user having already be created.
